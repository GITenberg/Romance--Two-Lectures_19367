1</span>THE ORIGIN OF ROMANCE</h2>
<p>The period of English political history which falls between 
Pitt&rsquo;s acceptance of office as prime minister, in 1783, and
the passing of the Reform Bill, in 1832, is a period rich in 
character and event.&nbsp; The same period of fifty years is one 
of the most crowded epochs of our national literature.&nbsp; In 
1783 William Blake produced his <i>Poetical Sketches</i>, and 
George Crabbe published <i>The Village</i>.&nbsp; In 1832 Scott 
died, not many months after the death of Goethe.&nbsp; Between 
these two dates a great company of English writers produced a 
literature of immense bulk, and of almost endless diversity of 
character.&nbsp; Yet one dominant strain in that literature has 
commonly been allowed to give a name to the whole period, and it 
is often called the Age of the Romantic Revival.</p>
<p>We do not name other notable periods of our literature in this
fashion.&nbsp; The name itself <!-- page 2--><a 
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>contains a 
theory, and so marks the rise of a new philosophical and 
aesthetic criticism.&nbsp; It attempts to describe as well as to 
name, and attaches significance not to kings, or great authors, 
but to the kind of writing which flourished conspicuously in that
age.&nbsp; A less ambitious and much more secure name would have 
been the Age of George III; but this name has seldom been used, 
perhaps because the writers of his time who reverenced King 
George III were not very many in number.&nbsp; The danger of 
basing a name on a theory of literature is that the theory may 
very easily be superseded, or may prove to be inadequate, and 
then the name, having become immutable by the force of custom, is
left standing, a monument of ancient error.&nbsp; The terminology
of the sciences, which pretends to be exact and colourless, is 
always being reduced to emptiness by the progress of 
knowledge.&nbsp; The thing that struck the first observer is 
proved to be less important than he thought it.&nbsp; Scientific 
names, for all their air of learned universality, are merely 
fossilized impressions, stereotyped portraits of a single 
aspect.&nbsp; The decorous obscurity of the <!-- page 3--><a 
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>ancient 
languages is used to conceal an immense diversity of 
principle.&nbsp; Mammal, amphibian, coleoptera, dicotyledon, 
cryptogam,&mdash;all these terms, which, if they were translated 
into the language of a peasant, would be seen to record very 
simple observations, yet do lend a kind of formal majesty to 
ignorance.</p>
<p>So it is with the vocabulary of literary criticism: the first 
use of a name, because the name was coined by someone who felt 
the need of it, is often striking and instructive; the impression
is fresh and new.&nbsp; Then the freshness wears off it, and the 
name becomes an outworn print, a label that serves only to recall
the memory of past travel.&nbsp; What was created for the needs 
of thought becomes a thrifty device, useful only to save 
thinking.&nbsp; The best way to restore the habit of thinking is 
to do away with the names.&nbsp; The word Romantic loses almost 
all its meaning and value when it is used to characterize whole 
periods of our literature.&nbsp; Landor and Crabbe belong to a 
Romantic era of poetry; Steele and Sterne wrote prose in an age 
which set before itself the Classic ideal.&nbsp; Yet there is 
hardly any distinctively Classical beauty in <!-- page 4--><a 
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>English verse 
which cannot be exemplified from the poetry of Landor and Crabbe;
and there are not very many characteristics of Romantic prose 
which find no illustration in the writings of Steele and 
Sterne.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the very name of romance has wielded 
such a power in human affairs, and has so habitually impressed 
the human imagination, that time is not misspent in exhibiting 
its historical bearings.&nbsp; These great vague words, invented 
to facilitate reference to whole centuries of human 
history&mdash;Middle Ages, Renaissance, Protestant Reformation, 
Revival of Romance&mdash;are very often invoked as if they were 
something ultimate, as if the names themselves were a sufficient 
explanation of all that they include.&nbsp; So an imperfect 
terminology is used to gain esteem for an artificial and rigid 
conception of things which were as fluid as life itself.&nbsp; 
The Renaissance, for instance, in its strict original meaning, is
the name for that renewed study of the classical literatures 
which manifested itself throughout the chief countries of Europe 
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.&nbsp; In Italy, where 
the movement had its origin, no <!-- page 5--><a 
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>single 
conspicuous event can be used to date it.&nbsp; The traditions 
inherited from Greece and Rome had never lost their authority; 
but with the increase of wealth and leisure in the city republics
they were renewed and strengthened.&nbsp; From being remnants and
memories they became live models; Latin poetry was revived, and 
Italian poetry was disciplined by the ancient masters.&nbsp; But 
the Renaissance, when it reached the shores of England, so far 
from giving new life to the literature it found there, at first 
degraded it.&nbsp; It killed the splendid prose school of Malory 
and Berners, and prose did not run clear again for a 
century.&nbsp; It bewildered and confused the minds of poets, and
blending itself with the national tradition, produced the rich 
lawlessness of the English sixteenth century.&nbsp; It was a 
strong tributary to the stream of our national literature; but 
the popular usage, which assigns all that is good in the English 
literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to a 
mysterious event called the Renaissance, is merely absurd.&nbsp; 
Modern scholars, if they are forced to find a beginning for 
modern literature, would prefer to <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>date it from 
the wonderful outburst of vernacular poetry in the latter part of
the twelfth century, and, if they must name a birthplace, would 
claim attention for the Court of King Henry II.</p>
<p>In some of its aspects, the Romantic revival may be exhibited 
as a natural consequence of the Renaissance.&nbsp; Classical 
scholarship at first scorned the vernacular literatures, and did 
all its work of criticism and imitation in the Latin 
tongue.&nbsp; By degrees the lesson was widened, and applied to 
the modern languages.&nbsp; Study; imitation in Latin; extension 
of classical usages and principles to modern 
literature,&mdash;these were the regular stages in the progress 
of the classical influence.&nbsp; When the poets of France and 
England, to name no others, had learned as much as they were able
and willing to learn from the masters of Greece and Rome, the 
work of the Renaissance was done.&nbsp; By the middle of the 
eighteenth century there was no notable kind of Greek or Latin 
literature&mdash;historical, philosophical, poetical; epic, 
elegy, ode, satire&mdash;which had not worthy disciples and 
rivals in the literatures of France and England.&nbsp; <!-- page 
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Nothing 
remained to do but to go further afield and seek for new 
masters.&nbsp; These might easily have been found among the poets
and prophets of the East, and not a few notable writers of the 
time began to forage in that direction.&nbsp; But the East was 
too remote and strange, and its languages were too little known, 
for this attempt to be carried far; the imitation of Chinese and 
Persian models was practised chiefly by way of fantasy and 
joke.&nbsp; The study of the neglected and forgotten matter of 
mediaeval times, on the other hand, was undertaken by serious 
scholars.&nbsp; The progress of the mediaeval influence 
reproduced very exactly the successive phases of the Classical 
Renaissance.&nbsp; At first there was study; and books like 
Sainte Palaye&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs of Ancient Chivalry</i>, and 
Paul Henri Mallet&rsquo;s <i>Northern Antiquities</i>, enjoyed a 
European reputation.&nbsp; Then followed the period of forgery 
and imitation, the age of Ossian and Chatterton, Horace Walpole 
and Bishop Percy.&nbsp; Lastly, the poets enrolled themselves in 
the new school, and an original literature, suggested by the old,
was created by Sir Walter <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Scott, Coleridge, and Keats.&nbsp; It 
was the temper of the antiquary and the sceptic, in the age of 
Gibbon and Hume, that begot the Romantic Revival; and the 
rebellion of the younger age against the spirit of the eighteenth
century was the rebellion of a child against its parents.</p>
<p>It is not needful, nor indeed is it possible, to define 
Romance.&nbsp; In the mathematical sciences definitions are 
all-important, because with them the definition is the 
thing.&nbsp; When a mathematician asks you to describe a circle, 
he asks you to create one.&nbsp; But the man who asks you to 
describe a monkey is less exacting; he will be content if you 
mention some of the features that seem to you to distinguish a 
monkey from other animals.&nbsp; Such a description must needs be
based on personal impressions and ideas; some features must be 
chosen as being more significant than the rest.&nbsp; In the 
history of literature there are only two really significant 
things&mdash;men, and books.&nbsp; To study the ascertained facts
concerning men and books is to study biography and bibliography, 
two sciences which between them supply the only <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>competent and 
modest part of the history of literature.&nbsp; To discern the 
significance of men and books, to classify and explain them, is 
another matter.&nbsp; We have not, and we never shall have, a 
calculus sufficient for human life even at its weakest and 
poorest.&nbsp; Let him who conceives high hopes from the progress
of knowledge and the pertinacity of thought tame and subdue his 
pride by considering, for a moment, the game of chess.&nbsp; That
game is played with thirty-two pieces, of six different kinds, on
a board of sixty-four squares.&nbsp; Each kind of piece has one 
allotted mode of action, which is further cramped by severe 
limitations of space.&nbsp; The conditions imposed upon the game 
are strict, uniform, and mechanical.&nbsp; Yet those who have 
made of chess a life-long study are ready to confess their 
complete ignorance of the fundamental merits of particular moves;
one game does not resemble another; and from the most commonplace
of developments there may spring up, on the sudden, wild romantic
possibilities and situations that are like miracles.&nbsp; If 
these surprising flowers of fancy grow on the chess-board, how 
shall we set a limit to the <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>possibilities
of human life, which is chess, with variety and uncertainty many 
million times increased?&nbsp; It is prudent, therefore, to say 
little of the laws which govern the course of human history, to 
avoid, except for pastime, the discussion of tendencies and 
movements, and to speak chiefly of men and books.&nbsp; If an 
author can be exhibited as the effect of certain causes (and I do
not deny that some authors can plausibly be so exhibited) he 
loses his virtue as an author.&nbsp; He thought of himself as a 
cause, a surprising intruder upon the routine of the world, an 
original creator.&nbsp; I think that he is right, and that the 
profitable study of a man is the study which regards him as an 
oddity, not a quiddity.</p>
<p>A general statement of the law that governs literary history 
may perhaps be borrowed from the most unreasonable of the 
arts&mdash;the art of dress.&nbsp; One of the powerful rulers of 
men, and therefore of books, is Fashion, and the fluctuations of 
literary fashion make up a great part of literary history.&nbsp; 
If the history of a single fashion in dress could ever be 
written, it would illuminate the literary problem.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>The motives at work are the same; thoughtful wearers of 
clothes, like thoughtful authors, are all trying to do something 
new, within the limits assigned by practical utility and social 
sympathy.&nbsp; Each desires to express himself and yet in that 
very act to win the admiration and liking of his fellows.&nbsp; 
The great object is to wear the weeds of humanity with a 
difference.&nbsp; Some authors, it is true, like timid or lazy 
dressers, desire only to conform to usage.&nbsp; But these, as M.
Bruneti&egrave;re remarks in one of his historical essays, are 
precisely the authors who do not count.&nbsp; An author who 
respects himself is not content if his work is mistaken for 
another&rsquo;s, even if that other be one of the gods of his 
idolatry.&nbsp; He would rather write his own signature across 
faulty work than sink into a copyist of merit.&nbsp; This eternal
temper of self-assertion, this spirit of invention, this 
determination to add something or alter something, is no doubt 
the principle of life.&nbsp; It questions accepted standards, and
makes of reaction from the reigning fashion a permanent force in 
literature.&nbsp; The young want something to do; they will not 
be loyal subjects in a kingdom <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>where no land
remains to be taken up, nor will they allow the praise of the 
dead to be the last word in criticism.&nbsp; Why should they 
paraphrase old verdicts?</p>
<p>The sway of Fashion often bears hardest on a good author just 
dead, when the generation that discovered him and acclaimed him 
begins to pass away.&nbsp; Then it is not what he did that 
attracts the notice of the younger sort, but what he left 
undone.&nbsp; Tennyson is discovered to be no great 
thinker.&nbsp; Pope, who, when his star was in the ascendant, was
&ldquo;Mr. Pope, the new Poet,&rdquo; has to submit to 
examination by the Headmaster of Winchester, who decides that he 
is not a poet, except in an inferior sense.&nbsp; Shakespeare is 
dragged to the bar by Thomas Rymer, who demonstrates, with what 
degree of critical ability is still disputed, but certainly in 
clear and vigorous English, that Shakespeare has no capacity for 
tragic writing.&nbsp; Dante is banished, by the critics of the 
Renaissance, into the Gothic darkness.&nbsp; So the pendulum of 
fashion swings to and fro, compelled, even in the shortest of its
variable oscillations, to revisit the greatest writers, who are 
nearest <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to the centre of rest.&nbsp; Wit and 
sense, which are raised by one age into the very essentials of 
good poetry, are denied the name of poetry by the next; 
sentiment, the virtue of one age, is the exploded vice of 
another; and Romance comes in and goes out with secular 
regularity.</p>
<p>The meaning of Romance will never come home to him who seeks 
for it in modern controversies.&nbsp; The name Romance is itself 
a memorial of the conquest of Europe by the Romans.&nbsp; They 
imposed their language on half Europe, and profoundly influenced 
the other half.&nbsp; The dialectical, provincial Latin, of 
various kinds, spoken by the conquered peoples, became the 
Romance speech; and Romance literature was the new literature 
which grew up among these peoples from the ninth century 
onwards,&mdash;or from an earlier time, if the fringe of Celtic 
peoples, who kept their language but felt the full influence of 
Christianity, be taken into the account.&nbsp; The chief thing to
be noted concerning Romance literature is that it was a Christian
literature, finding its background and inspiration in the ideas 
to which the Christian Church gave currency.&nbsp; <!-- page 
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>While
Rome spread her conquests over Europe, at the very heart of her 
empire Christianity took root, and by slow process transformed 
that empire.&nbsp; During the Middle Ages the Bishops of Rome sat
in the seat of the Roman Emperors.&nbsp; This startling change 
possessed Gibbon&rsquo;s imagination, and is the theme of his 
great work.&nbsp; But the whole of Gibbon&rsquo;s history was 
anticipated and condensed by Hobbes in a single 
sentence&mdash;&ldquo;If a man considers the original of this 
great ecclesiastical dominion, he will easily perceive that the 
Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased Roman Empire, 
sitting crowned upon the grave thereof.&nbsp; For so did the 
Papacy start up on a sudden out of the ruins of that heathen 
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, is the answer to a question which at once suggests
itself.&nbsp; How do we get this famous opposition between the 
older Latin literature and the literature of those countries 
which had inherited or accepted the Latin tradition?&nbsp; Why 
did not the Romans hand over their literature and teach it, as 
they handed over and taught their law?&nbsp; They did teach it in
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>their schools; grammar and rhetoric, two of the chief 
subjects of a liberal education, were purely literary studies, 
based on the work of the literary masters of Rome.&nbsp; Never 
was there an education so completely literary as the organized 
education of Rome and of her provinces.&nbsp; How came it that 
there was any breach between the old and the new?</p>
<p>A question of this kind, involving centuries of history, does 
not admit of a perfectly simple answer.&nbsp; It may be very 
reasonably maintained that in Rome education killed 
literature.&nbsp; A carefully organized, universal system of 
education, which takes for its material the work of great poets 
and orators, is certain to breed a whole army of slaves.&nbsp; 
The teachers, employed by the machine to expound ideas not their 
own, soon erect systems of pedantic dogma, under which the living
part of literature is buried.&nbsp; The experience of ancient 
Rome is being repeated in the England of to-day.&nbsp; The 
officials responsible for education, whatever they may uneasily 
pretend, are forced by the necessities of their work to encourage
uniformity, and national education becomes a warehouse of <!-- 
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>second-hand goods, presided over by men who cheerfully 
explain the mind of Burke or of Shakespeare, adjusting the place 
of each, and balancing faults against merits.&nbsp; But Roman 
education throughout the Empire had further difficulties to 
encounter.&nbsp; To understand these it must be remembered what 
Latin literature was.&nbsp; The Latins, when we first discern 
them in the dim light of the past, were a small, strenuous, 
political people, with a passion for government and war.&nbsp; 
They first subdued Italy, and no very serious culture-problem 
resulted from that conquest.&nbsp; The Etruscans certainly 
contributed much to Latin civilization, but their separate 
history is lost.&nbsp; No one knows what the Etruscans 
thought.&nbsp; The Romans do not seem to have cared.&nbsp; They 
welded Italy together, and thereafter came into contact with the 
older, richer civilizations of the Mediterranean shores.&nbsp; 
The chief of these, in its influence, was the Greek civilization,
as it had developed in that famous group of free city states, 
fostered by the sun and air, and addicted to life.&nbsp; In 
Athens, at the time of her glory, life was not a habit, but an 
experiment.&nbsp; Even <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the conservative Romans were 
infected.&nbsp; They fell under the sway of Greek thought.&nbsp; 
When a practical man of business becomes intimate with an artist,
he is never the same man again.&nbsp; The thought of that 
disinterested mode of life haunts his dreams.&nbsp; So Rome, 
though she had paid little regard to the other ancient peoples 
with whom she had had traffic and war, put herself to school to 
the Greeks.&nbsp; She accepted the Greek pantheon, renamed the 
Greek gods and goddesses, and translated and adopted Greek 
culture.&nbsp; The real Roman religion was a religion of the 
homestead, simple, pious, domestic, but they now added foreign 
ornaments.&nbsp; So also with literature; their own native 
literature was scanty and practical&mdash;laws and rustic 
proverbs&mdash;but they set themselves to produce a new 
literature, modelled on the Greek.&nbsp; Virgil followed Homer; 
Plautus copied Menander; and Roman literature took on that 
secondary and reminiscent character which it never lost.&nbsp; It
was a literature of culture, not of creed.&nbsp; This people had 
so practical a genius that they could put the world in harness; 
for the decoration of the world they were willing to depend on 
foreign loans.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>In so far as Latin literature was founded on the Greek, 
that is, in so far as it was a derivative and imitative 
literature, it was not very fit for missionary purposes.&nbsp; 
One people can give to another only what is its own.&nbsp; The 
Greek gods were useless for export.&nbsp; An example may be taken
from the English rule in India.&nbsp; We can give to the peoples 
of India our own representative institutions.&nbsp; We can give 
them our own authors, Shakespeare, Burke, Macaulay.&nbsp; But we 
cannot give them Homer and Virgil, who nevertheless continue to 
play an appreciable part in training the English mind; and we can
hardly give them Milton, whose subtlest beauties depend on the 
niceties of the Latin speech.&nbsp; The trial for Latin 
literature came when obscurely, in the purlieus and kennels of 
Rome, like a hidden fermentation, Christianity arose.&nbsp; The 
earliest Christians were for the most part illiterate; but when 
at last Christianity reached the high places of the government, 
and controlled the Empire, a problem of enormous difficulty 
presented itself for solution.&nbsp; The whole elaborate 
educational system of the Romans was founded <!-- page 19--><a 
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>on the older 
literature and the older creeds.&nbsp; All education, law, and 
culture were pagan.&nbsp; How could the Christians be educated; 
and how, unless they were educated, could they appeal to the 
minds of educated men?&nbsp; So began a long struggle, which 
continued for many centuries, and swayed this way and that.&nbsp;
Was Christianity to be founded barely on the Gospel precepts and 
on a way of life, or was it to seek to subdue the world by 
yielding to it?&nbsp; This, the religious problem, is the chief 
educational problem in recorded history.&nbsp; There were the 
usual parties; and the fiercest, on both sides, counselled no 
surrender.&nbsp; Tertullian, careful for the purity of the new 
religion, held it an unlawful thing for Christians to become 
teachers in the Roman schools.&nbsp; Later, in the reign of 
Julian the Apostate, an edict forbade Christians to teach in the 
schools, but this time for another reason, lest they should draw 
away the youth from the older faith.&nbsp; In the end the result 
was a practical compromise, arranged by certain ecclesiastical 
politicians, themselves lovers of letters, between the old world 
and the new.&nbsp; It was agreed, in effect, that the schools 
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>should teach humane letters and mythology, leaving it to
the Church to teach divine doctrine and the conduct of 
life.&nbsp; All later history bears the marks of this 
compromise.&nbsp; Here was the beginning of that distinction and 
apportionment between the secular and the sacred which is so much
more conspicuous in Christian communities than ever it has been 
among the followers of other religions.&nbsp; Here also was the 
beginning of that strange mixture, familiar to all students of 
literature, whereby the Bible and Virgil are quoted as equal 
authorities, Plato is set over against St. Paul, the Sibyl 
confirms the words of David, and, when a youth of promise, 
destined for the Church, is drowned, St. Peter and a river-god 
are the chief mourners at his poetic obsequies.&nbsp; This 
mixture is not a fantasy of the Renaissance; it has been part and
parcel, from the earliest times, of the tradition of the 
Christian church.</p>
<p>History is larger than morality; and a wise man will not 
attempt to pass judgment on those who found themselves in so 
unparalleled a position.&nbsp; A new religion, claiming an 
authority not of this world, prevailed in this world, <!-- page 
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and 
was confronted with all the resources of civilization, 
inextricably entangled with the ancient pagan faiths.&nbsp; What 
was to be done?&nbsp; The Gospel precepts seemed to admit of no 
transaction.&nbsp; &ldquo;They that say such things declare 
plainly that they seek a country.&nbsp; And truly, if they had 
been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they 
might have had opportunity to have returned.&nbsp; But now they 
desire a better country, that is an heavenly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
material prosperity and social order which Law and Politics take 
such pains to preserve and increase are no part of their 
care.&nbsp; They are strangers and pilgrims in the country where 
they pitch their tent for a night.&nbsp; How dare they spend time
on cherishing the painted veil called Life, when their desires 
are fixed on what it conceals?&nbsp; When Tacitus called the 
Christian religion &ldquo;a deadly superstition,&rdquo; he spoke 
as a true Roman, a member of the race of Empire-builders.&nbsp; 
His subtle political instinct scented danger from those who 
looked with coldness on the business and desire of this 
world.&nbsp; The Christian faith, which presents no social 
difficulties while it is professed <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>here and 
there by a lonely saint or seer, is another thing when it becomes
the formal creed of a nation.&nbsp; The Christians themselves 
knew that to cut themselves off from the country of their birth 
would have been a fatal choice, so far as this world is 
concerned.&nbsp; Their ultimate decision was to accept Roman 
civilization and Roman culture, and to add Christianity to 
it.</p>
<p>Then followed an age-long attempt to Christianize Latin 
literature, to supply believers with a new poetry, written in 
polished and accomplished verse, and inspired by Christian 
doctrine.&nbsp; Of those who attempted this task, Prudentius is 
perhaps the greatest name.&nbsp; The attempt could never have 
been very successful; those who write in Latin verse must submit 
to be judged, not by the truth of their teaching, but by the 
formal beauties of their prosody, and the wealth of their 
allusive learning.&nbsp; Even Milton, zealot though he be, is 
esteemed for his manner rather than for his matter.&nbsp; But the
experiment was cut short by the barbarian invasions.&nbsp; When 
the Empire was invaded, St. Jerome and St. Augustine, Prudentius 
and <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>Symmachus, Claudian and Paulinus of Nola, were all 
alive.&nbsp; These men, in varying degrees, had compounded and 
blended the two elements, the pagan and the Christian.&nbsp; The 
two have been compounded ever since.&nbsp; The famous sevententh 
century controversy concerning the fitness of sacred subjects for
poetic treatment is but a repetition and an echo of that older 
and more vital difference.&nbsp; The two strains could never be 
perfectly reconciled, so that a certain impurity and confusion 
was bequeathed to modern European literature, not least to 
English literature.&nbsp; Ours is a great and various literature,
but its rarest virtue is simplicity.&nbsp; Our best ballads and 
lyrics are filled with the matter of faith, but as often as we 
try the larger kinds of poetry, we inevitably pass over into 
reminiscence, learning, criticism,&mdash;in a word, culture.</p>
<p>The barbarians seized, or were granted, land; and settled down
under their chiefs.&nbsp; They accepted Christianity, and made it
into a warlike religion.&nbsp; They learned and 
&ldquo;corrupted&rdquo; the Latin language.&nbsp; In their 
dialects they had access neither to the literature of ancient 
Rome, <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>nor to the imitative scholarly 
Christian literature, poetry and homily, which competed with 
it.&nbsp; Latin continued to be the language of religion and 
law.&nbsp; It was full of terms and allusions which meant nothing
to them.&nbsp; They knew something of government,&mdash;not of 
the old republic, but of their own men and estates.&nbsp; They 
believed wholly and simply in Christianity, especially the 
miraculous part of it.&nbsp; To them (as to all whom it has most 
profoundly influenced) it was not a philosophy, but a history of 
marvellous events.&nbsp; When, by the operation of society, their
dialect had formed itself, a new literature, unlike anything that
had flourished in ancient Rome, grew up among them.&nbsp; This 
was Romance, the great literary form of the Middle Ages.&nbsp; It
was a sincere literature, expressive of their pride in arms and 
their simple religious faith.&nbsp; The early songs and ballads, 
chanted in the Romance speech, have all perished.&nbsp; From a 
later time there have come down to us the <i>Chansons de 
Geste</i>, narrative poems composed by the professional caste of 
poets to celebrate the deeds and adventures of the knights who 
fought the battles of Charlemagne against the Saracen 
invader.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
25</span>The note of this Romance literature is that it was 
actual, modern, realistic, at a time when classical literature 
had become a remote convention of bookish culture.&nbsp; It was 
sung in the banqueting-hall, while Latin poetry was read in the 
cells of monks.&nbsp; It flourished enormously, and extended 
itself to all the matter of history and legend, to King Arthur, 
Theseus, Alexander, ancient heroes and warriors who were brought 
alive again in the likeness of knights and emperors.&nbsp; Its 
triumph was so complete, that its decadence followed 
swiftly.&nbsp; Like the creatures that live in the blood of man, 
literary forms and species commonly die of their own 
excess.&nbsp; Romances were multiplied, and imitated; 
professional poets, not content with marvels that had now become 
familiar, sought for a new sensation in extravagant language and 
incident.&nbsp; The tales became more and more sophisticated, 
elaborate, grotesque, and unreal, until, in the fourteenth 
century, a stout townsman, who ticketed bales in a custom-house, 
and was the best English poet of his time, found them 
ridiculous.&nbsp; In <i>Sir Thopas</i> Chaucer parodies the 
popular literature of his <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>day.&nbsp; 
Sir Thopas is a great reader of romances; he models himself on 
the heroes whose deeds possess his imagination, and scours the 
English countryside, seeking in vain for the fulfilment of his 
dreams of prowess.</p>
<p>So Romance declined; and by the end of the seventeenth century
the fashion is completely reversed; the pendulum has swung back; 
now it is the literature inspired by the old classical models 
that is real, and handles actual human interests, while Romantic 
literature has become remote, fictitious, artificial.&nbsp; This 
does not mean that the men of the later seventeenth century 
believed in the gods and Achilles, but not in the saints and 
Arthur.&nbsp; It means that classical literature was found best 
to imitate for its form.&nbsp; The greater classical writers had 
described the life of man, as they saw it, in direct and simple 
language, carefully ordered by art.&nbsp; After a long 
apprenticeship of translation and imitation, modern writers 
adopted the old forms, and filled them with modern matter.&nbsp; 
The old mythology, when it was kept, was used allegorically and 
allusively.&nbsp; Common-sense, pointedly expressed, with some 
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>traditional ornament and fable, became the matter of 
poetry.</p>
<p>A rough summary of this kind is enough to show how large a 
question is involved in the history of Romance.&nbsp; All 
literary history is a long record of the struggle between those 
two rival teachers of man&mdash;books, and the experience of 
life.&nbsp; Good books describe the world, and teach whole 
generations to interpret the world.&nbsp; Because they throw 
light on the life of man, they enjoy a vast esteem, and are set 
up in a position of authority.&nbsp; Then they generate other 
books; and literature, receding further and further from the 
source of truth, becomes bookish and conventional, until those 
who have been taught to see nature through the spectacles of 
books grow uneasy, and throw away the distorting glasses, to look
at nature afresh with the naked eye.&nbsp; They also write books,
it may be, and attract a crowd of imitators, who produce a 
literature no less servile than the literature it supplants.</p>
<p>This movement of the sincere and independent human mind is 
found in the great writers of all periods, and is called the 
Return to Nature.&nbsp; <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>It is seen in Pope no less than in 
Wordsworth; in <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> no less than in 
<i>Peter Bell</i>.&nbsp; Indeed the whole history of the 
mock-heroic, and the work of Tassoni, Boileau, and Pope, the 
three chief masters in that kind, was a reassertion of sincerity 
and nature against the stilted conventions of the late literary 
epic.&nbsp; The <i>Iliad</i> is the story of a quarrel.&nbsp; 
What do men really quarrel about?&nbsp; Is there any more 
distinctive mark of human quarrels than the eternal triviality of
the immediate cause?&nbsp; The insulting removal of a memorial 
emblem from an Italian city; the shifting of a reading-desk from 
one position to another in a French church; the playful theft of 
a lock of hair by an amorous young English nobleman&mdash;these 
were enough, in point of fact, to set whole communities by the 
ears, and these are the events celebrated in <i>The Rape of the 
Bucket</i>, <i>The Rape of the Lectern</i>, <i>The Rape of the 
Lock</i>.&nbsp; How foolish it is to suppose that nature and 
truth are to be found in one school of poetry to the exclusion of
another!&nbsp; The eternal virtues of literature are sincerity, 
clarity, breadth, force, and subtlety.&nbsp; They are to <!-- 
page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>be found, in diverse combinations, now here and now 
there.&nbsp; While the late Latin Christian poets were bound over
to Latin models&mdash;to elegant reminiscences of a faded 
mythology and the tricks of a professional rhetoric&mdash;there 
arose a new school, intent on making literature real and 
modern.&nbsp; These were the Romance poets.&nbsp; If they 
pictured Theseus as a duke, and Jason as a wandering knight, it 
was because they thought of them as live men, and took means to 
make them live for the reader or listener.&nbsp; The realism of 
the early literature of the Middle Ages is perhaps best seen in 
old Irish.&nbsp; The monk bewails the lawlessness of his 
wandering thoughts, which run after dreams of beauty and pleasure
during the hour of divine service.&nbsp; The hermit in the wood 
describes, with loving minuteness, the contents of his 
larder.&nbsp; Never was there a fresher or more spontaneous 
poetry than the poetry of this early Christian people.&nbsp; But 
it is not in the direct line of descent, for it was written in 
the Celtic speech of a people who did not achieve the government 
of Europe.&nbsp; The French romances inherited the throne, and 
passed through all the stages of <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>elaboration 
and decadence.&nbsp; They too, in their turn, became a 
professional rhetoric, false and tedious.&nbsp; When they ceased 
to be a true picture of life, they continued in esteem as a 
school of manners and deportment for the fantastic gallantry of a
court.&nbsp; Yet through them all their Christian origin 
shines.&nbsp; Their very themes bear witness to the teaching of 
Christian asceticism and Christian idealism.&nbsp; The quest of a
lady never seen; the temptations that present themselves to a 
wandering knight under the disguise of beauty and 
ease;&mdash;these, and many other familiar romantic plots borrow 
their inspiration from the same source.&nbsp; Not a few of the 
old fairy stories, preserved in folk-lore, are full of religious 
meaning&mdash;they are the Christian literature of the Dark 
Ages.&nbsp; Nor is it hard to discern the Christian origins of 
later Romantic poetry.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s morality has little 
enough of the religious character:</p>
<blockquote><p>Know then this truth (enough for Man to know),<br 
/>
Virtue alone is Happiness below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Coleridge, when he moralizes, speaks the language of 
Christianity:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>He prayeth best, who loveth best<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All things both great and small;<br />
For the dear God who loveth us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He made and loveth all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The like contrast holds between Dryden and Shelley.&nbsp; It 
is perhaps hardly fair to take an example from Dryden&rsquo;s 
poems on religion; they are rational arguments on difficult 
topics, after this fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>In doubtful questions &rsquo;tis the safest way<br
/>
To learn what unsuspected ancients say;<br />
For &rsquo;tis not likely we should higher soar<br />
In search of heaven than all the church before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Dryden writes in his most fervent and magnificent style, 
he writes like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not rake the Dunghill of thy Crimes,<br />
For who would read thy Life that reads thy rhymes?<br />
But of King <i>David&rsquo;s</i> Foes be this the Doom,<br />
May all be like the Young-man <i>Absalom</i>;<br />
And for my Foes may this their Blessing be,<br />
To talk like <i>Doeg</i> and to write like Thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor is it fair to bring Shelley&rsquo;s lame satires into 
comparison with these splendors.&nbsp; When Shelley is inspired 
by his demon, this is how he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>To suffer woes which Hope thinks 
infinite;<br />
To forgive wrongs darker than death or night;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To defy Power which seems omnipotent;<br />
To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates<br />
From its own wreck the thing it contemplates;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent;<br />
This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be<br />
Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free;<br />
This is alone Life, Joy, Empire and Victory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the great poets of the Romantic Revival took mediaeval
literature for their model, but they did more than that.&nbsp; 
They returned to the cult of wild nature; they reintroduced the 
supernatural, which is a part of the nature of man; they 
described seas, and deserts, and mountains, and the emotions of 
the soul in loneliness.&nbsp; But so soon as it passed out of the
hands of the greater poets, this revived Romance became as 
bookish as decadent Classicism, and ran into every kind of 
sentimental extravagance.&nbsp; Indeed revived Romance also 
became a school of manners, and by making a fashion and a code of
rare emotions, debased the descriptive parts of the 
language.&nbsp; A description by any professional reporter of any
Royal wedding is further from the truth to-day <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>than it was 
in the eighteenth century.&nbsp; The average writer is looser and
more unprincipled.</p>
<p>The word Romance supplies no very valuable instrument of 
criticism even in regard to the great writers of the early 
nineteenth century.&nbsp; Wordsworth, like Defoe, drew straight 
from the life.&nbsp; Those who will may call him a 
Romantic.&nbsp; He told of adventures&mdash;the adventures of the
mind.&nbsp; He did not write of Bacchus, Venus, and Apollo; 
neither did he concern himself with Merlin, Tristram, and the 
Lady of the Lake.&nbsp; He shunned what is derived from other 
books.&nbsp; His theme is man, nature, and human life.&nbsp; 
Scott, in rich and careless fashion, dealt in every kind of 
material that came his way.&nbsp; He described his own country 
and his own people with loving care, and he loved also the 
melodrama of historical fiction and supernatural legend.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;His romance and antiquarianism,&rdquo; says Ruskin, 
&ldquo;his knighthood and monkery, are all false, and he knows 
them to be false.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly, <i>The Heart of 
Midlothian</i> and <i>The Antiquary</i> are better than 
<i>Ivanhoe</i>.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s love for the knighthood and 
monkery was real, but it was playful.&nbsp; His heart was with 
Fielding.</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>There is nothing inconsistent in the best of the 
traditions of the two parties.&nbsp; The Classical school taught 
simplicity, directness, and modesty of speech.&nbsp; They are 
right: it is the way to tell a ghost story.&nbsp; The Romantic 
school taught a wider imaginative outlook and a more curious 
analysis of the human mind.&nbsp; They also are right: it is the 
way to investigate a case in the police courts.&nbsp; Both were 
cumbered, at times, with the dead things that they found in the 
books they loved.&nbsp; All literature, except the strongest and 
purest, is cumbered with useless matter&mdash;the conventional 
epithet, the grandiose phrase, the outworn classical quotation, 
the self-conscious apology, the time-honored joke.&nbsp; But 
there are only two schools of literature&mdash;the good, and the 
bad.&nbsp; As for national legend, its growth is the same in all 
ages.&nbsp; The Greeks told tales of Achilles, the Romans of 
Aeneas, the French of Charlemagne, the British of Arthur.&nbsp; 
It is a part of the same process, and an expression of the same 
humanity.</p>
<p>I have tried to show that the Renaissance bears the same 
relation to classical literature as <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the Revival 
of Romance bears to mediaeval literature, and that the whole 
history of the literature of Europe is an oscillation between 
Christian and Pagan ideals during that long and wavering process 
whereby Christianity was partially established as the creed and 
way of life of a group of diverse nations.&nbsp; The historical 
meaning of the word Romance is exact and easy to define.&nbsp; 
But in common usage the word means something much vaguer than 
this.&nbsp; It is a note, an atmosphere, a kind of feeling that 
is awakened not only by literature but by the behavior of men and
the disposition of material objects.&nbsp; John Evelyn, the 
diarist, enjoys the reputation of having been the first to speak 
of a &ldquo;romantic site,&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which leads the 
way to immeasurable possibilities in the application of the 
word.&nbsp; Accuracy in the definition of this larger meaning is 
unattainable; and would certainly be false, for the word has 
taken its meaning from centuries of usage by inaccurate 
thinkers.&nbsp; A whole cluster of feelings, impressions, and 
desires, dimly recognized as cognate, has grown around the word, 
which has now been a centre of critical discussion <!-- page 
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and 
controversy for the better part of a century.&nbsp; Heine, in his
dissertation on the Romantic School, takes the Christianity of 
the Middle Ages as his starting-point, and relates everything to 
that.&nbsp; Perhaps he makes too much of allegory and symbolism, 
which have always been dear to the church, but are not 
conspicuous in early Romance.&nbsp; Yet no one can go far astray 
who keeps in touch, as Heine does, with the facts of 
history.&nbsp; Goethe, impatient of the wistful intensities of 
youth, said that the Classical is health, and the Romantic 
disease.&nbsp; Much has been made, by many critics, of the statue
and the picture, as types of ancient and modern art, the one 
complete in itself, the other suggesting more than it 
portrays.&nbsp; Mr. Walter Pater, borrowing a hint from a 
sentence of Bacon, finds the essence of Romance in the addition 
of strangeness to beauty, of curiosity to desire.&nbsp; It would 
be easy to multiply these epigrammatic statements, which are all 
not obscurely related to the fundamental changes wrought on the 
world by Christian ideas.&nbsp; No single formula can hope to 
describe and distinguish two eras, or define two tempers <!-- 
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>of mind.&nbsp; If I had to choose a single 
characteristic of Romance as the most noteworthy, I think I 
should choose Distance, and should call Romance the magic of 
Distance.&nbsp; What is the most romantic line in Virgil?&nbsp; 
Surely it is the line which describes the ghosts, staying for 
waftage on the banks of the river, and stretching out their hands
in passionate desire to the further shore:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott expounds the harmonizing power of distance in his 
<i>Journal</i>, where he describes the funeral of his friend 
Laidlaw&rsquo;s infant:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw the poor child&rsquo;s funeral from a 
distance.&nbsp; Ah, that Distance!&nbsp; What a magician for 
conjuring up scenes of joy or sorrow, smoothing all asperities, 
reconciling all incongruities, veiling all absurdness, softening 
every coarseness, doubling every effect by the influence of the 
imagination.&nbsp; A Scottish wedding should be seen at a 
distance; the gay band of the dancers just distinguished amid the
elderly group of the spectators,&mdash;the glass held high, and 
the distant cheers as it is swallowed, should be only a sketch, 
not a finished Dutch picture, when it becomes brutal and 
boorish.&nbsp; Scotch psalmody, too, should be heard from a 
distance.&nbsp; The grunt and the snuffle, and the whine and the 
scream, should be all blended in that <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>deep and 
distant sound, which rising and falling like the Eolian harp, may
have some title to be called the praise of our Maker.&nbsp; Even 
so the distant funeral: the few mourners on horseback with their 
plaids wrapped around them&mdash;the father heading the 
procession as they enter the river, and pointing out the ford by 
which his darling is to be carried on the last long 
road&mdash;not one of the subordinate figures in discord with the
general tone of the incident&mdash;seeming just accessories, and 
no more&mdash;this <i>is</i> affecting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same idea is the subject of T. E. Brown&rsquo;s poem, 
<i>The Schooner</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just mark that schooner westward
far at sea&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis but an hour ago<br />
When she was lying hoggish at the quay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And men ran to and fro,<br />
And tugged, and stamped, and shoved, and pushed and swore,<br />
And ever and anon, with crapulous glee,<br />
Grinned homage to viragoes on the shore.<br />
* * * * *<br />
And now, behold! a shadow of repose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a line of gray,<br />
She sleeps, that transverse cuts the evening rose&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She sleeps, and dreams away,<br />
Soft blended in a unity of rest<br />
All jars, and strifes obscene, and turbulent throes,<br />
&rsquo;Neath the broad benediction of the West.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>Shelley finds the suggestion of distance in beautiful 
music:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the sound overpowers,<br 
/>
Sing again, with thy sweet voice revealing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of some world far from ours,<br />
Where music and moonlight and feeling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wordsworth hears it in the song of the Highland Girl:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will no one tell me what she sings?&mdash;<br />
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br />
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And battles long ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These quotations are enough to show what a width of view is 
given to modern Romantic poetry.&nbsp; Man is, in one sense, more
truly seen in a wide setting of the mountains and the sea than 
close at hand in the street.&nbsp; But the romantic effect of 
distance may delude and conceal as well as glorify and 
liberate.&nbsp; The weakness of the modern Romantic poet is that 
he must keep himself aloof from life, that he may see it.&nbsp; 
He rejects the authority, and many of the pleasures, along with 
the duties, of society.&nbsp; He looks out from his window on the
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>men fighting in the plain, and sees them transfigured 
under the rays of the setting sun.&nbsp; He enjoys the battle, 
but not as the fighters enjoy it.&nbsp; He nurses himself in all 
the luxury of philosophic sensation.&nbsp; He does not help to 
bury the child, or to navigate the schooner, or to discover the 
Fortunate Islands.&nbsp; The business of every poet, it may be 
said, is vision, not action.&nbsp; But the epic poet holds his 
reader fast by strong moral bonds of sympathy with the actors in 
the poem.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should have liked to do that&rdquo; is 
what the reader says to himself.&nbsp; He is asked to think and 
feel as a man, not as a god.</p>
<p>The weakness of revived Romance found the most searching of 
its critics in Tennyson, who was fascinated, when he was shaping 
his own poetic career, by the picture and the past, yet could not
feel satisfied with the purely aesthetic attitude of art to 
life.&nbsp; In poem after poem he returns to the question, Is 
poetry an escape from life?&nbsp; Must it lull the soul in a 
selfish security?&nbsp; The struggle that went on in his mind has
left its mark on <i>The Lady of Shalott</i>, <i>The Palace of 
Art</i>, <i>The Voyage</i>, <i>The Vision of </i><!-- page 
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span><i>Sin</i>, <i>The Lotos-Eaters</i>, and others of his 
poems.&nbsp; The Lady of Shalott lives secluded in her bower, 
where she weaves a magic web with gay colors.&nbsp; She has heard
that a curse will fall on her if she looks out on the world and 
down to the city of Camelot.&nbsp; She sees the outer world only 
in a mirror, and</p>
<blockquote><p>In her web she still delights<br />
To weave the mirror&rsquo;s magic sights</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;villages, market-girls, knights riding two and two, 
funerals, or pairs of lovers wandering by.&nbsp; At last she 
grows half-sick of seeing the world only in shadows and 
reflections.&nbsp; Then a sudden vivid experience breaks up this 
life of dream.&nbsp; Sir Lancelot rides past, in shining armor, 
singing as he rides.&nbsp; She leaves her magic web and mirror, 
and looks upon the real world.</p>
<blockquote><p>Out flew the web and floated wide;<br />
The mirror crack&rsquo;d from side to side;<br />
&ldquo;The curse is come upon me,&rdquo; cried<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She goes into the world, and there she meets her death.&nbsp; 
The poem is not an allegory, but there is no mistaking the 
thought that generated <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>it.&nbsp; The mirror and the web are 
the emblems of Romantic art.&nbsp; The feelings which stir the 
heart to action, which spring to meet the occasion or the object,
are contrasted, in the poem, with the more pensive feelings which
are excited by the sight of the object in a mirror, and the 
suggestions of color and design which are to be transferred to 
the embroidery.&nbsp; The mirror is a true and subtle 
symbol.&nbsp; When Shakespeare treated the same problem, he made 
King Richard II, the most romantically minded of all his kings, 
call for a mirror.&nbsp; The thing that it is easiest for a man 
to see in a mirror is himself; egotism in its many forms, 
self-pity, self-cultivation, self-esteem, dogs Romanticism like 
its shadow.&nbsp; The desire to be the spectator of your own 
life, to see yourself in all kinds of heroic and pathetic 
attitudes, is the motive-power of Romantic poetry in many of its 
later developments.&nbsp; Yet life must be arrested and falsified
before the desire can be fulfilled.&nbsp; No one has ever seen 
himself in a mirror as he is seen by others.&nbsp; He cannot 
catch himself looking away, self-forgetful, intent on something 
outward; yet only when he <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>is in these 
attitudes does his true character show itself in his face.&nbsp; 
Nor, if he could so see himself, would he be a witness of the 
truth.&nbsp; The sensation of drowning, or of leading an assault 
in war, is very unlike the sentiment which is aroused in the 
spectator of either of these adventures.&nbsp; Romanticism, in 
its decline, confuses the sentiment with the sensation, and 
covets the enjoyment of life on the easy terms of a 
by-stander.</p>
<p>These faults and failings of late Romance are far enough 
removed from the simple heroism of the death of Roland in the 
pass of Roncesvalles.&nbsp; Later Romance is known everywhere by 
its derivative, secondary, consciously literary character.&nbsp; 
Yet it draws sometimes from the original source of inspiration, 
and attains, by devious ways, to poetic glories not inferior to 
the old.</p>
<h2><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>IMITATION AND FORGERY</h2>
<p>Romance is a perennial form of modern literature, and has 
passed through many phases.&nbsp; No period has been without it, 
though the esteem in which it is held has varied a good deal from
age to age.&nbsp; English literature is strong in romance; there 
is something in the English temper which makes scepticism 
ungrateful to it, and disposes it to treat even dreams 
seriously.&nbsp; Chaucer, who laughed at the romantic writers of 
his day, yet gave a new lease of life to Romance in <i>Troilus 
and Cressida</i> and <i>The Knightes Tale</i>.&nbsp; Many of the 
poets of the seventeenth century chose romantic themes for their 
most serious work; if Davenant and Chamberlayne and others had 
been as successful as they were ambitious, they would have 
anticipated the Revival of Romance.&nbsp; Even in the age of 
Pope, the old romance subjects were still popular, though <!-- 
page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>they were celebrated in books which have long been 
forgotten.&nbsp; Everyone who has studied the Troy legend of the 
Middle Ages knows how great a share in the popularization of the 
legend belongs to the Sicilian lawyer, Guido delle Colonne, who 
summarized, in the dull style of a Latin chronicle, and without 
acknowledgment, the brilliant <i>Roman de Troie</i> which the 
French poet, Beno&icirc;t de Sainte-More had written for Queen 
Eleanor of England.&nbsp; Guide&rsquo;s matter-of-fact 
compilation had an enormous vogue; Chaucer, Lydgate, and 
Shakespeare treated it as an authority; and Caxton translated it 
into English prose.&nbsp; Through all the changes of fashion 
Caxton&rsquo;s version continued in esteem; it was repeatedly 
revised and reissued; and, in the very age of Pope, found what 
was doubtless a large public under the title <i>The Destruction 
of Troy</i>, <i>In Three Books . . . With many Admirable Acts of 
Chivalry and Martial Prowess</i>, <i>effected by Valiant 
Knights</i>, <i>in the Defence and Love of distressed 
Ladies.&nbsp; The Thirteenth Edition</i>, <i>Corrected and much 
Amended</i>.&nbsp; London, <i>Printed for Eben. Tracey</i>, <i>at
the Three Bibles </i><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 46</span><i>on London-Bridge</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>1708</i>.&nbsp; In the underworld of literature Romance never 
died out.&nbsp; The Revival of Romance took its special character
from a gradual and powerful reaction against Dryden and Pope and 
all those masters of Classical method who, during half a century,
had legislated for English poetry.&nbsp; It began very early in 
the eighteenth century, long before the death of Pope.&nbsp; No 
sooner did a dynasty of moralists and satirists claim possession 
of the high places, and speak in the name of English literature, 
than all the other interests and kinds, which survived among the 
people, began to range themselves in opposition, and to assert 
their right to be heard.&nbsp; The supremacy of Dryden and Pope 
was the most despotic rule that English poetry has ever known, 
and the revolt was strong in proportion.&nbsp; Satire and 
morality very easily becomes tedious, especially when they are in
close alliance.&nbsp; Despotism may be tempered by epigrams, and 
so become tolerable, but it is important that the epigrams should
not be made by the despot.&nbsp; Outside the charmed circle of 
his friendships, Pope was ready enough to use his wit against any
pretender.</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>The change began gradually, and in very innocent 
fashion.&nbsp; Poetry had been taught to be scholarly, 
self-conscious, experimental; and it showed its skill in 
half-playful imitations of the older English masters.&nbsp; Pope 
himself imitated Chaucer and Spenser in burlesque fashion.&nbsp; 
John Philips, in <i>The Splendid Shilling</i>, used 
Milton&rsquo;s heightened style to describe the distresses of an 
impecunious poet.&nbsp; William Shenstone in <i>The 
School-mistress</i>, parodied Spenser, yet the parody is in no 
way hostile, and betrays an almost sentimental admiration.&nbsp; 
Spenser, like Milton, never lost credit as a master, though his 
fame was obscured a little during the reign of Dryden.&nbsp; His 
style, it must be remembered, was archaic in his own time; it 
could not grow old, for it had never been young.&nbsp; Addison, 
in <i>An Account of the Greatest English Poets</i>, says that 
Spenser&rsquo;s verse</p>
<blockquote><p>Can charm an understanding age no more;<br />
The long-spun allegories fulsome grow,<br />
While the dull moral lies too plain below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the <i>Account</i> is a merely juvenile work; its dogma is
not the sword of judgment, but <!-- page 48--><a 
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the shield of
ignorance.&nbsp; &ldquo;The character he gives of Spenser,&rdquo;
said Pope, &ldquo;is false; and I have heard him say that he 
never read Spenser till fifteen years after he wrote 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for Pope himself, among the English poets 
Waller, Spenser, and Dryden were his childhood&rsquo;s favorites,
in that order; and the year before his death he said to 
Spence&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is; there is 
something in Spenser that pleases one as strongly in one&rsquo;s 
old age as it did in one&rsquo;s youth.&nbsp; I read the Faerie 
Queene, when I was about twelve, with infinite delight; and I 
think it gave me as much when I read it over, about a year or two
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lyrical Milton and the romantic Spenser found disciples 
among poets in the early half of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; 
Two of these disciples may be mentioned, both born about the year
1700, only twelve years later than Pope.&nbsp; John Dyer, the son
of a solicitor in Wales, was bred to the law, but gave it up to 
study painting under Jonathan Richardson.&nbsp; His earlier and 
better poems were written while he wandered about South Wales in 
pursuit of his art.&nbsp; <i>Grongar Hill</i>, the most <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>notable of them, was published in 1726.&nbsp; Love of 
the country is what inspires his verses, which have a very 
winning simplicity, only touched here and there by the 
conventions deemed proper for poetry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Grass and flowers Quiet treads,<br />
On the meads and mountain-heads,<br />
Along with Pleasure, close ally&rsquo;d,<br />
Ever by each other&rsquo;s side;<br />
And often, by the murmuring rill,<br />
Hears the thrush, while all is still,<br />
Within the groves of Grongar Hill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth of his observation endeared him to Wordsworth; and 
his moral, when he finds a moral, is without violence:</p>
<blockquote><p>How close and small the hedges lie!<br />
What streaks of meadows cross the eye!<br />
A step methinks may pass the stream,<br />
So little distant dangers seem;<br />
So we mistake the Future&rsquo;s face,<br />
Ey&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; Hope&rsquo;s deluding glass;<br />
As yon summits soft and fair,<br />
Clad in colours of the air,<br />
Which, to those who journey near,<br />
Barren, and brown, and rough appear,<br />
Still we tread tir&rsquo;d the same coarse way,<br />
The present&rsquo;s still a cloudy day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>It takes a good poet to strike a clear note, with no 
indecision, in the opening lines of his poem, as Dyer does in 
<i>The Country Walk</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am resolv&rsquo;d, this charming day,<br />
In the open fields to stray;<br />
And have no roof above my head<br />
But that whereon the Gods do tread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His landscapes are delicately etched, and are loved for their 
own sake:</p>
<blockquote><p>And there behold a bloomy mead,<br />
A silver stream, a willow shade,<br />
Beneath the shade a fisher stand,<br />
Who, with the angle in his hand,<br />
Swings the nibbling fry to land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be absurd to speak solemnly of Dyer&rsquo;s debt to 
Milton; he is an original poet; but the writer of the lines 
quoted above can never have been blind to the beauties of 
<i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i>.&nbsp; His two 
arts brought him little material prosperity; in 1740 he took 
orders in the Church of England, and in his later years did harm 
to his fame by a long industrial poem called <i>The Fleece</i>, 
which has on it none of the dew that glistens on his youthful 
verses.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>James Thomson, who won a great reputation in his own 
age, was the son of a parish minister in Scotland.&nbsp; He was 
educated in Edinburgh, and came to London to seek his 
fortune.&nbsp; All Thomson&rsquo;s work shows the new tendencies 
in poetry struggling with the accepted fashions.&nbsp; His 
language in <i>The Seasons</i> is habitually rhetorical and 
stilted, yet there is hardly a page without its vignettes of 
truth and beauty.&nbsp; When he forgets what he has learned in 
the Rhetoric class, and falls back on his own memories and 
likings, the poet in him reappears.&nbsp; In <i>The Castle of 
Indolence</i>, published just before his death in 1748, he 
imitates Spenser.&nbsp; One stanza of this poem is more famous 
than all the rest; it is pure and high romance:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when a shepherd of the 
Hebrid-Isles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Placed far amid the melancholy main,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Whether it be lone fancy him beguiles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or that a&euml;rial beings sometimes deign<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To stand embodied to our senses plain),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sees on the naked hill, or valley low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The whilst in ocean Phoebus dips his wain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A vast assembly moving to and fro;<br />
Then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>Many who are familiar with this simile have never been 
at the pains to remember, or enquire, what it illustrates.&nbsp; 
Indeed its appearance in the poem is almost startling, as if it 
were there for no purpose but to prophesy of the coming glories 
of English poetry.&nbsp; The visitors to the Castle of Indolence 
are met at the gate by the porter, who supplies them with 
dressing-gowns and slippers, wherein to take their ease.&nbsp; 
They then stroll off to various parts of the spacious grounds, 
and their disappearance is the occasion for this wonderful 
verse.&nbsp; Thomson cared no more than his readers for the 
application of the figure; what possessed him was his memory of 
the magic twilight on the west coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>Pope and Prior were metropolitan poets; it is worth noting 
that Dyer belonged to Wales, and Thomson to Scotland.&nbsp; It is
even more significant that Dyer was by profession a painter, and 
that Thomson&rsquo;s poems were influenced by memories of the 
fashionable school of landscape painting.&nbsp; The development 
of Romantic poetry in the eighteenth century is inseparably 
associated with pictorial art, and especially with <!-- page 
53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the 
rise of landscape painting.&nbsp; Two great masters of the 
seventeenth century, Salvator Rosa and Claude Lorrain, are more 
important than all the rest.&nbsp; We have here to do not with 
the absolute merits of painting, nor with its technical beauties 
and subtleties, but with its effect on the popular imagination, 
which in this matter does not much differ from the poetic 
imagination.&nbsp; The landscapes of Salvator Rosa and Claude 
were made familiar to an enormous public by the process of 
engraving, and poetry followed where painting led.&nbsp; There 
are exquisite landscapes in the backgrounds of the great Italian 
masters; Leonardo, Titian, and others; but now the background 
became the picture, and the groups of figures were reduced to 
serve as incidents in a wider scheme.&nbsp; Exactly the same 
change, the same shift of the centre of interest, may be seen in 
Thomson&rsquo;s poetry compared with Spenser&rsquo;s.&nbsp; No 
doubt it would be difficult to balance the creditor and debtor 
account as between poetry and painting; the earlier pictorial 
landscapes borrowed some hints from the older romances; but in 
England, at least, landscapes of wild rocks, <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and calm 
lakes, and feudal castles lit up by the glow of the setting sun 
were familiar before the reaction in poetry set in.&nbsp; 
Romance, in its modern development, is largely a question of 
background.&nbsp; A romantic love-affair might be defined as a 
love-affair in other than domestic surroundings.&nbsp; Who can 
use the word &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; with more authority than 
Coleridge?&nbsp; In <i>Kubla Khan</i>, a poem which some would 
choose as the high-water mark of English romantic poetry, he gets
his effect from the description of a landscape combining the 
extremes of beauty and terror:</p>
<blockquote><p>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br 
/>
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br />
A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br />
As e&rsquo;er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br />
By woman wailing for her demon lover!<br />
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br />
* * * * *<br />
It flung up momently the sacred river.<br />
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br />
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br />
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br />
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;<br />
And &rsquo;mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br />
Ancestral voices prophesying war!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>Romance demands scenery; and it should never be 
forgotten that the age of Pope, the age of symmetry and 
correctness in poetry, was an age when the taste for wild scenery
in painting and in gardening was at its height.&nbsp; If the 
house was set in order, the garden broke into a wilderness.&nbsp;
Addison in the <i>Spectator</i> (No. 414) praises the new art of 
landscape gardening:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is generally in nature something more grand 
and august, than what we meet with in the curiosities of 
art.&nbsp; When, therefore, we see this imitated in any measure, 
it gives us a nobler and more exalted kind of pleasure, than what
we receive from the nicer and more accurate productions of 
art.&nbsp; On this account our <i>English</i> gardens are not so 
entertaining to the fancy as those in <i>France</i> and 
<i>Italy</i>, where we see a larger extent of ground covered over
with an agreeable mixture of garden and forest, which represent 
everywhere an artificial wildness, much more charming than that 
neatness and elegancy which we meet with in those of our own 
country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Addison would have hesitated to apply this doctrine to poetry;
indeed the orthodoxy of that age favored the highest possible 
contrast between the orderly works of man, and the garden, <!-- 
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>which it chose to treat as the outpost of rebellious 
nature.&nbsp; Pope was a gardener as well as a poet, and his 
gardening was extravagantly romantic.&nbsp; He describes his 
ideal garden in the <i>Epistle to the Earl of Burlington</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let not each beauty everywhere be spy&rsquo;d,<br 
/>
Where half the skill is decently to hide.<br />
He gains all points, who pleasingly confounds,<br />
Surprises, varies, and conceals the bounds.<br />
Consult the genius of the place in all;<br />
That tells the waters or to rise, or fall;<br />
Or helps th&rsquo; ambitious hill the heav&rsquo;ns to scale,<br 
/>
Or scoops in circling theatres the vale;<br />
Calls in the country, catches opening glades,<br />
Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades;<br />
Now breaks, or now directs, th&rsquo; intending lines;<br />
Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope carried out these ideas as well as he could in his garden
at Twickenham, where he attempted to compress every variety of 
scenic effect within the space of five acres, so that it became a
kind of melodramatic peep-show.&nbsp; The professional 
landscape-gardeners worked on a larger scale; the two chief of 
them perhaps were Bridgeman, who invented the haha for the 
purpose of concealing the bounds; and William <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Kent, 
Pope&rsquo;s associate and contemporary, who disarranged old 
gardens, and designed illustrations for Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie
Queene</i>.&nbsp; Kent was an architect and bad painter, much 
favored by George I.&nbsp; Lord Chesterfield compares him to 
Apelles, who alone was permitted to paint the portrait of 
Alexander:</p>
<blockquote><p>Equal your varied wonders! save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This difference we see,<br />
One would no other painter have&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No other would have thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 1716 onward he was much employed by the Earl of 
Burlington.&nbsp; He helped to lay out Stowe, in Buckinghamshire,
with a fresh and surprising view at every turn; the wandering 
visitor was introduced, among other delights, to the Hermitage, 
the Temple of Venus, the Egyptian pyramid, St. Augustine&rsquo;s 
cave (artfully constructed of roots and moss), the Saxon Temple, 
the Temple of Bacchus, and Dido&rsquo;s cave.&nbsp; The craze for
romantic gardening, with its illusions of distance, and its ruins
and groves, persisted throughout the eighteenth century.&nbsp; 
Shenstone&rsquo;s garden at The Leasowes enjoyed a higher 
reputation even than his <!-- page 58--><a 
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>poetry, and 
it is well known how he strained his slender means in the effort 
to outshine his neighbors.&nbsp; &ldquo;In time,&rdquo; says 
Johnson, &ldquo;his expenses brought clamours about him that 
overpowered the lamb&rsquo;s bleat and the linnet&rsquo;s song; 
and his groves were haunted by beings very different from fauns 
and fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief of Kent&rsquo;s successors was Launcelot Brown, 
commonly called &ldquo;Capability Brown&rdquo; from his habit of 
murmuring to himself, as he gazed on a tract of land submitted 
for his diagnosis&mdash;&ldquo;It has capabilities; it has 
capabilities.&rdquo;&nbsp; He laid out Kew and Blenheim.&nbsp; 
Gazing one day on one of his own made rivers, he exclaimed, with 
an artist&rsquo;s rapture,&mdash;&ldquo;Thames!&nbsp; 
Thames!&nbsp; Thou wilt never forgive me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
certainly imposed himself upon his own time, and, so far, was a 
great man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Brown,&rdquo; said Richard Owen 
Cambridge, &ldquo;I very earnestly wish that I may die before 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said Brown with some 
surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should 
like to see Heaven before you had improved it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among
the romantic writers who were bitten by the mania for picturesque
improvement were Horace <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Walpole and even Sir Walter 
Scott.&nbsp; Everyone knows how Walpole bought from Mrs. 
Chevenix, the toy-shop woman, a little house called 
&ldquo;Chopp&rsquo;d Straw Hall&rdquo; which he converted into 
the baronial splendors of Strawberry Hill; and how Scott 
transmitted a mean Tweedside farm, called Clarty Hole, into the 
less pretentious glories of Abbotsford.</p>
<p>After the practice came the theory.&nbsp; The painters and 
landscape-gardeners were followed by a school of philosophers, 
who expounded Taste and the laws of the Picturesque.&nbsp; Some 
extracts from the work of one of these, Thomas Whately, whose 
<i>Observations on Modern Gardening</i> appeared in 1770, will 
show to what excesses the whole nonsensical business had been 
carried.&nbsp; &ldquo;In wild and romantic scenes,&rdquo; says 
Whately, &ldquo;may be introduced a ruined stone bridge, of which
some arches may be still standing, and the loss of those which 
are fallen may be supplied by a few planks, with a rail, thrown 
over the vacancy.&nbsp; It is a picturesque object: it suits the 
situation; and the antiquity of the passage, the care taken to 
keep it still open, though the original building <!-- page 
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>is 
decayed, the apparent necessity which thence results for a 
communication, give it an imposing air of reality.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The context of this passages shows that the bridge leads 
nowhither.&nbsp; On the management of rocks Whately is a 
connoisseur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their most distinguished 
characters,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are <i>dignity</i>, 
<i>terror</i>, and <i>fancy</i>: the expressions of all are 
constantly wild; and sometimes a rocky scene is only wild, 
without pretensions to any particular character.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
ruins are what he likes best, and he recommends that they shall 
be constructed on the model of Tintern Abbey.&nbsp; They must be 
obvious ruins, much dilapidated, or the visitors will examine 
them too closely.&nbsp; &ldquo;An appendage evidently more modern
than the principal structure will sometimes corroborate the 
effect; the shed of a cottager amidst the remains of a temple, is
a contrast both to the former and the present state of the 
building.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems almost impossible that this 
should have been offered as serious advice; but it was the 
admired usage of the time.&nbsp; Whately&rsquo;s book was a 
recognized authority, and ran through several editions.&nbsp; He 
is also known as a Shakespeare critic, of no particular mark.</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>A more influential writer than Whately was William 
Gilpin, an industrious clergyman and schoolmaster, who spent his 
holidays wandering and sketching in the most approved parts of 
England, Wales and Scotland.&nbsp; His books on the Picturesque 
were long held in esteem.&nbsp; The earliest of them was entitled
<i>Observations on the River Wye and several parts of South Wales
. . . relative chiefly to picturesque beauty</i> (1782).&nbsp; 
Others, which followed in steady succession, rendered a like 
service to the Lake district, the Highlands of Scotland, the New 
Forest, and the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; Those books taught the 
aesthetic appreciation of wild nature to a whole 
generation.&nbsp; It is a testimony to their influence that for a
time they enslaved the youth of Wordsworth.&nbsp; In <i>The 
Prelude</i> he tells how, in early life, he misunderstood the 
teaching of Nature, not from insensibility, but from the 
presumption which applied to the impassioned life of Nature the 
&ldquo;rules of mimic art.&rdquo;&nbsp; He calls this habit 
&ldquo;a strong infection of the age,&rdquo; and tells how he 
too, for a time, was wont to compare scene with scene, and to 
pamper himself &ldquo;with meagre novelties of <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>colour and 
proportion.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another passage he speaks of similar 
melodramatic errors, from conformity to book-notions, in his 
early study of poetry.</p>
<blockquote><p>The dignities of plain occurrence then<br />
Were tasteless, and truth&rsquo;s golden mean, a point,<br />
Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But imaginative power, and the humility which had been his in 
childhood, returned to him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook the habit off<br />
Entirely and for ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet in one curious respect Gilpin&rsquo;s amateur teaching did
leave its mark on the history of English poetry.&nbsp; When 
Wordsworth and Coleridge chose the Wye and Tintern Abbey for 
their walking tour, they were probably determined in that 
direction by the fame of the scenery; and when they and Southey 
settled in the Lake district, it may be surmised that they felt 
other and stronger attractions than those that came from 
Wordsworth&rsquo;s early associations with the place.&nbsp; The 
Wye, Tintern Abbey, the English Lakes, the Scottish 
Highlands&mdash;these were the favored places of the <!-- page 
63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>apostles of the picturesque, and have now become 
memorial places in our poetic history.</p>
<p>All these gardeners and aesthetic critics who busied 
themselves with wild nature were aiming at an ideal which had 
been expressed in many painted landscapes, and had been held up 
as the top of admiration by one of the greatest English 
poets.&nbsp; The influence of Milton on the new landscape 
interest must be held to be not less than the influence of his 
contemporaries, Salvator Rosa and Claude.&nbsp; His descriptions 
of Paradise did more than any painting to alter the whole 
practice of gardening.&nbsp; They are often appealed to, even by 
the technical gardeners.&nbsp; In garden-lore Milton was a 
convinced Romantic.&nbsp; He has two descriptions of the Garden 
of Eden; the slighter of the two occurs on the occasion of 
Raphael&rsquo;s entry, and merely resumes the earlier and fuller 
account:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their glittering tents they passed, and now is 
come<br />
Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,<br />
And flowering Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;<br />
A Wilderness of Sweets; for Nature here<br />
Wantoned as in her prime and plaid at will<br />
Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,<br />
Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>Coleridge has some remarks, in his <i>Table Talk</i>, on
Milton&rsquo;s disregard of painting.&nbsp; There are only two 
pictures, he says, in Milton; Adam bending over the sleeping Eve,
and the entrance of Dalilah, like a ship under full sail.&nbsp; 
Certainly the above lines are no picture; but they are more 
exciting than any clear delineation could be; they are full of 
scent, and air, and the emotions of ease and bliss.&nbsp; The 
other passage has more of architectural quality in it, and 
describes what first met Satan&rsquo;s gaze, when he entered the 
Garden and sat, perched like a cormorant, upon the Tree of 
Life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisped 
Brooks<br />
With mazie error under pendant shades<br />
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed<br />
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art<br />
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon<br />
Poured forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine<br />
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote<br />
The open field, and where the unpierc&rsquo;t shade<br />
Imbround the noontide Bowers: Thus was this place,<br />
A happy rural seat of various view:<br />
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,<br />
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde<br />

Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Here is all the variety of hill and valley, wood and lawn, 
rock and meadow, waterfall and lake, rose and vine, which the 
landscape artists also loved to depict, and which, together with 
ruined temples and castles, unknown in Paradise, became the 
cherished ideal of landscape gardening.&nbsp; By the influence of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> upon the gardeners, no less than by the 
influence of <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i> upon 
the poets, Milton may claim to be regarded as <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>one of the 
forefathers of the Romantic Revival.&nbsp; There is no need to 
distinguish carefully between poetry and painting in discussing 
their contributions to Romance.&nbsp; A great outcry was raised, 
in the last age, against literary criticism of pictures.&nbsp; 
But in this question we are concerned with this effect of 
pictures on the normal imagination, which is literary, which 
cares for story, and suggested action, and the whole chain of 
memories and desires that a picture may set in motion.&nbsp; Do 
not most of those who look at a romantic landscape imagine 
themselves wandering among the scenes that are portrayed?&nbsp; 
And are not men prone to admire in Nature what they have been 
taught by Art to notice?&nbsp; The landscape art of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries taught them to imagine 
themselves in lonely scenes, among old ruins or frowning rocks, 
by the light of sunrise or sunset, cast on gleaming lakes.&nbsp; 
These were the theatre of Romance; and the emotions awakened by 
scenes like these played an enormous part in the Revival.&nbsp; 
It was thus that poets were educated to find that exaltation in 
the terrors of mountainous regions which <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Gray 
expressed when he said: &ldquo;Not a precipice, not a torrent, 
not a cliff, but is pregnant with religion and poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weaker side of modern Romance, the play-acting and 
pretence that has always accompanied it, may be seen in the 
gardening mania.&nbsp; It was not enough to be a country 
gentleman; the position must be improved by the added elegances 
of a hermit&rsquo;s cell and an Egyptian pyramid.&nbsp; It is 
like children&rsquo;s play; the day is long, the affairs of our 
elders are tedious, we are tired of a life in which there is no 
danger and no hunger; let us pretend that we are monks, or 
ancient Romans.&nbsp; The mature imagination interprets the 
facts; this kind of imagination escapes from the facts into a 
world of make-believe, where the tyranny and cause and effect is 
no longer felt.&nbsp; It is not a hard word to call it childish; 
the imagination of these early Romantics had a child&rsquo;s 
weakness and a child&rsquo;s delightful confidence and zest.</p>
<p>The same play activity expressed itself in literature, where 
an orgy of imitation ushered in the real movement.&nbsp; The 
antiquarian beginnings of Romantic poetry may be well illustrated
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>by the life and works of Thomas Warton.&nbsp; He passed 
his life as a resident Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and 
devoted his leisure, which was considerable, to the study of 
English poetry and Gothic architecture.&nbsp; He was not yet 
thirty when, in 1757, he was elected Professor of Poetry, a post 
which he held for ten years.&nbsp; During this time he planned a 
complete History of English Poetry, a task which Pope and Gray in
turn had contemplated and abandoned.&nbsp; The historical 
interest which is so conspicuous in early Romanticism owed not a 
little, it may be remarked in passing, to the initiative of Pope,
who must therefore be given a place in any full genealogy of the 
Romantic family.&nbsp; Warton&rsquo;s <i>History</i>, so far as 
it was completed, was published between 1774 and 1781, when he 
relaxed his efforts, and took up lesser tasks.&nbsp; In 1785 he 
was made Poet Laureate on the strength of his early poems and 
later scholarship.&nbsp; He died in 1790.</p>
<p>Warton&rsquo;s poems are a curious study.&nbsp; Spenser and 
Milton are his masters, and he is a docile pupil.&nbsp; His 
poetry is all derivative, and might be best described as 
imitation poetry.&nbsp; Christopher <!-- page 69--><a 
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>North said of
him that &ldquo;the gods had made him poetical, but not a 
poet,&rdquo; a saying which contains the whole truth.&nbsp; He 
puts together a mosaic of phrases borrowed from his teachers, and
frames them in a sentimental setting of his own.&nbsp; Here are 
some passages from <i>The Pleasures of Melancholy</i>, which, 
though he wrote it at the age of seventeen, does not differ in 
method or inspiration from the rest of his poetical work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beneath yon ruin&rsquo;d abbey&rsquo;s moss-grown 
piles<br />
Oft let me sit, at twilight hour of eve,<br />
Where thro&rsquo; some western window the pale moon<br />
Pours her long-levell&rsquo;d rule of streaming light;<br />
While sullen sacred silence reigns around,<br />
Save the lone screech-owl&rsquo;s note, who builds his 
bow&rsquo;r<br />
Amid the mould&rsquo;ring caverns dark and damp,<br />
Or the calm breeze, that rustles in the leaves<br />
Of flaunting ivy, that with mantle green<br />
Invests some wasted tow&rsquo;r. . . .<br />
Then, when the sullen shades of ev&rsquo;ning close,<br />
Where thro&rsquo; the room a blindly-glimm&rsquo;ring gleam<br />
The dying embers scatter, far remote<br />
From Mirth&rsquo;s mad shouts, that thro&rsquo; th&rsquo; 
illumin&rsquo;d roof<br />
Resound with festive echo, let me sit,<br />
Blest with the lowly cricket&rsquo;s drowsy dirge. . . .<br />
O come then, Melancholy, queen of thought!<br />
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>O come with saintly look, and steadfast step,<br />
From forth thy cave embower&rsquo;d with mournful yew,<br />
Where ever to the curfeu&rsquo;s solemn sound<br />
List&rsquo;ning thou sitt&rsquo;st, and with thy cypress bind<br 
/>
Thy votary&rsquo;s hair, and seal him for thy son.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Melancholy seems not to have answered these advances.&nbsp; In
later life Warton was a short, squat, red-faced man, fond of ale,
and a cheerful talker, with a thick utterance, so that he gobbled
like a turkey-cock.&nbsp; Some of his verses are cheerful.&nbsp; 
This is from the <i>Ode on the Approach of Summer</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Haste thee, Nymph! and hand in hand<br />
With thee lead a buxom band;<br />
Bring fantastic-footed Joy,<br />
With Sport, that yellow-tressed boy:<br />
Leisure, that through the balmy sky<br />
Chases a crimson butterfly.<br />
Bring Health, that loves in early dawn<br />
To meet the milk-maid on the lawn;<br />
Bring Pleasure, rural nymph, and Peace,<br />
Meek, cottage-loving shepherdess!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is all like this, fluent and unnecessary.&nbsp; Perhaps no 
verses in English were ever made so exactly in the approved 
fashion of modern Latin verses.&nbsp; Warton writes pleasantly, 
his <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>cento of reminiscences is skilful, and his own epithets 
are sometimes happy, yet nothing comes of it.&nbsp; His work 
suggests the doubt whether any modern Latin verse, even the best,
would deceive an intelligent citizen of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>The strange thing about the Romantic Revival is that an 
epidemic of this sort of imitation at last produced real poetry 
and real romance.&nbsp; The industrious simulation of the 
emotions begot the emotions simulated.&nbsp; Is there not a story
told of a young officer who, having dressed himself in a sheet to
frighten his fellows, was embarrassed by the company of a real 
ghost, bent on the same errand; and retired from the enterprise, 
leaving it wholly to the professional?&nbsp; That, at any rate, 
is very much what happened to the Romantic impersonators.</p>
<p>Another parallel may perhaps be found in the power of 
vulgarity to advance civilization.&nbsp; Take, for instance, the 
question of manners.&nbsp; Politeness is a codification of the 
impulses of a heart that is moved by good will and consideration 
for others.&nbsp; If the impulses are not <!-- page 72--><a 
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>there, the 
politeness is so far unreal and insincere&mdash;a cheap 
varnish.&nbsp; Yet it is insisted on by society, and enforced by 
fear and fashion.&nbsp; If the forms are taught, the soul of them
may be, and sometimes is, breathed in later.&nbsp; So this 
imitative and timid artifice, this conformity to opinions the 
ground and meaning of which is not fully understood, becomes a 
great engine of social progress.&nbsp; Imitation and forgery, 
which are a kind of literary vulgarity, were the school of 
Romanticism in its nonage.&nbsp; Some of the greater poets who 
passed this way went on to express things subtler and more 
profound than had found a voice in the poetry that they 
imitated.</p>
<p>The long debate on the so-called poems of Ossian is now 
ended.&nbsp; They are known to be a not very skilful forgery by 
James Macpherson.&nbsp; Yet their importance in literary history 
remains undiminished, and the life of Macpherson has a curious 
kind of pathos.&nbsp; He was the creature and victim of the 
Romantic movement, and was led, by almost insensible degrees, 
into supplying fraudulent evidence for the favorite Romantic 
theory that a truer and deeper <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>vein of 
poetry is to be found among primitive peoples.&nbsp; 
Collins&rsquo;s <i>Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the 
Highlands of Scotland</i> and Gray&rsquo;s <i>Bard</i> show the 
literary world prepared to put itself to school to Celtic 
tradition.&nbsp; Macpherson supplied it with a body of poetry 
which exactly fulfilled its expectations.&nbsp; The crucial date 
in his history is his meeting in 1759 with John Home, the author 
of the once famous tragedy of <i>Douglas</i>.&nbsp; In the summer
of that year Home was drinking the waters at Moffat, and among 
the visitors assembled there found Thomas Graham, afterwards Lord
Lynedoch, then a boy of ten, and his tutor, James Macpherson, a 
young Highlander, shy and ambitious, who had been educated at 
Aberdeen and Edinburgh, and had dabbled in verse.&nbsp; Home, 
full of the literary gossip of the hour, seized upon the 
opportunity to question Macpherson concerning the poems that were
rumored to have survived among the Gaelic-speaking population of 
Scotland.&nbsp; In the light of what we now know it is not 
difficult to understand the genesis of this great European 
fraud.&nbsp; Macpherson was proud of his race, which he had <!-- 
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>celebrated in an heroic poem called <i>The 
Highlander</i>.&nbsp; He had interested himself in Gaelic poetry,
though his knowledge of the tongue was not good, and he had by 
him some fragments of genuine Gaelic poems.&nbsp; He was 
flattered by Home&rsquo;s appeal to him, and, feeling perhaps 
that the few and slight genuine poems which he could produce 
would hardly warrant the magnificence of his allusions to Gaelic 
literature, he forged a tale in poetic prose, called <i>The Death
of Oscar</i>, and presented it to Home as a translation from the 
Gaelic.&nbsp; The poem was much admired, and Macpherson, unable 
now to retrace his steps without declaring himself a cheat, soon 
produced others from the same source.&nbsp; These were submitted 
to the literary society of Edinburgh, with the great Dr. Blair at
its head, and were pronounced to be the wonder of the 
world.&nbsp; From this point onward, during a long and melancholy
life, poor Macpherson was enslaved to the fraud which had its 
beginning in the shyness and vanity of his own character.&nbsp; 
He was bound now to forge or to fail; and no doubt the 
consciousness that it was his own work which <!-- page 75--><a 
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>called forth 
such rapturous applause supported him in his labors and justified
him to his own conscience.&nbsp; A subscription was easily raised
in Edinburgh to enable him to travel and collect the remains of 
Celtic poetry.&nbsp; For a few months he perambulated the western
highlands and islands, and returned to Edinburgh bringing with 
him <i>Fingal</i>, a complete epic poem in six books.&nbsp; This 
was followed by <i>Temora</i>, in eight books, also attributed to
the great Gaelic bard Ossian; and the new Celtic fashion was 
established.</p>
<p>These poems had an immense success.&nbsp; Everyone knows how 
they influenced the youth of Goethe, and captured the imagination
of Napoleon.&nbsp; It is less surprising that they enraptured the
poet Gray, and were approved by the professor Blair, for they 
were exactly modelled on the practice and theory of these two 
critics.&nbsp; All the fashionable doctrine of that age 
concerning the history of poetry was borne out by these 
works.&nbsp; Poetry, so it was held, is to be found in its 
perfection only in primitive society, before it is overlaid by 
the complexities of modern civilization.&nbsp; Its <!-- page 
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>most 
perfect, and therefore its earliest, form, is the epic; and Dr. 
Blair must have been delighted to find that the laws of the epic,
which he so often explained to his class in Edinburgh University,
were minutely observed by the oldest of Scottish bards.&nbsp; He 
died without suspecting that the inspiration of the Ossianic 
poems had come partly from himself.</p>
<p>The belief that Celtic literature is essentially and eternally
melancholy,&mdash;a belief which persisted down to the time of 
Matthew Arnold, also drew its strength from the poems of 
Ossian.&nbsp; Here again theory showed the way to practice.&nbsp;
The melancholy of the Ossianic poems is not the melancholy of the
Celt, but a melancholy compounded of many simples, and extracted 
from works that were held in high esteem in the eighteenth 
century&mdash;Young&rsquo;s <i>Night Thoughts</i>, Blair&rsquo;s 
<i>Grave</i>, Gray&rsquo;s <i>Bard</i>, and the soliloquies of 
Milton&rsquo;s Satan.</p>
<p>Macpherson was soon challenged, and his whole life was passed 
in a brawl of controversy.&nbsp; Two famous men dismissed him 
contemptuously.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson, who knew what honesty means 
among scholars, treated him as an impudent <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>impostor.&nbsp; Wordsworth, who knew what simplicity 
means in poetry, declared that all the imagery of the poems is 
false and spurious.&nbsp; But the whole question early became a 
national quarrel, and the honor of Scotland was involved in 
it.&nbsp; There are signs that Macpherson would gladly have 
escaped from the storm he had raised.&nbsp; Aided by his early 
literary success, he became a prosperous man, held a well-paid 
post at court, entered Parliament, and was pensioned by the 
government.&nbsp; Still the controversy persisted.&nbsp; He had 
found it easy to take up a haughty attitude towards those hostile
critics who had doubted his good faith and had asked him to 
produce his Gaelic originals.&nbsp; But now the demand for the 
originals came from his champions and friends, who desired to 
place the fame of Scotland&rsquo;s oldest and greatest poet on a 
sure foundation.&nbsp; He wriggled on the hook, and more than 
once timidly hinted that the poems owed not a little to the 
poetic genius of the translator.&nbsp; But this half-hearted 
attempt to rob the great Ossian of a part of his fame stirred the
Caledonian enthusiasts to a frenzy of indignation.&nbsp; At last,
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>when he was no longer able to restrain his supporters, 
the wretched Macpherson found no escape but one.&nbsp; In middle 
age, some twenty years after his first appearance on the poetic 
horizon, he sat down, with a heavy heart and an imperfect 
knowledge of the Gaelic tongue, to forge the originals.&nbsp; In 
1807, eleven years after his death, these were at last 
published.&nbsp; The progress of genuine Celtic scholarship 
during the succeeding century did the rest; and the old blind 
bard rejoined the mists and vapors which were the inspiration of 
his Muse. <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78" 
class="citation">[78]</a>&nbsp; The poems of Ossian are only one,
though perhaps the most signal, instance of the forgeries which 
prevailed like an epidemic at the time of the Romantic 
Revival.&nbsp; Some of these, like Ireland&rsquo;s Shakespeare 
forgeries, were little better than cold-blooded mercenary 
frauds.&nbsp; Others, like Chatterton&rsquo;s Rowley Poems and 
Horace Walpole&rsquo;s <i>Castle of Otranto</i>, are full of the 
zest and delight of play-acting.&nbsp; Even Coleridge&rsquo;s 
<i>Ancient Mariner</i>, though it is free from the reproach of 
forgery, is touched by the <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>same 
spirit.&nbsp; The severe morality of scholarship had not yet been
applied to mediaeval or modern matter.&nbsp; Scholars are the 
trustees of poets; but where this trust is undertaken by men who 
are poets themselves, there is usually a good deal of gaiety and 
exuberance in its performance.</p>
<p>I have now traced some of the neglected sources of revived 
Romance, and have shown how in this movement, more notably, 
perhaps, than in any other great movement in literature, it was 
not the supply which created the demand, but the demand which 
created the supply.&nbsp; The Romantic change was wrought, not by
the energy of lonely pioneers, but by a shift in public 
taste.&nbsp; Readers of poetry knew what it was they wanted, even
before they knew whether it existed.&nbsp; Writers were soon at 
hand to prove that it had existed in the past, and could still be
made.&nbsp; The weakness of vague desire is felt everywhere in 
the origins of the change.&nbsp; Out of the weakness came 
strength; the tinsel Gothic castle of Walpole was enlarged to 
house the magnanimous soul of Scott; the Sorrows of Werther gave 
birth to <i>Faust</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>The weakness of the Romantic movement, its love of mere 
sensation and sentiment, is well exhibited in its effect upon the
sane and strong mind of Keats.&nbsp; He was a pupil of the 
Romantics; and poetry, as he first conceived of it, seemed to 
open to him boundless fields of passive enjoyment.&nbsp; His 
early work shows the struggle between the delicious swoon of 
reverie and the growing pains of thought.&nbsp; His verse, in its
beginnings, was crowded with &ldquo;luxuries, bright, milky, 
soft, and rosy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a boy at the time of 
England&rsquo;s greatest naval glory, but he thinks more of Robin
Hood than of Nelson.&nbsp; If Robin Hood could revisit the 
forest, says Keats,</p>
<blockquote><p>He would swear, for all his oaks<br />
Fallen beneath the dockyard strokes,<br />
Have rotted on the briny seas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His use of a word like &ldquo;rich,&rdquo; as Mr. Robert 
Bridges has remarked, is almost inhuman in its luxurious 
detachment from the human situation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now more than ever seems it rich to die,<br />
To cease upon the midnight with no pain.<br />
<!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
81</span>Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,<br />
Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By his work in this kind Keats became the parent and founder 
of the Aesthetic School of poetry, which is more than half in 
love with easeful death, and seeks nothing so ardently as rest 
and escape from the world.&nbsp; The epilogue to the Aesthetic 
movement was written by William Morris before ever he broke out 
from those enchanted bowers:</p>
<blockquote><p>So with this earthly paradise it is,<br />
If ye will read aright, and pardon me<br />
Who strive to build a shadowy isle of bliss<br />
Midmost the beating of the steely sea,<br />
Where tossed about all hearts of men must be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose ravening monsters mighty men must slay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not the poor singer of an empty 
day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet there is another side to the work of Keats, more wonderful
in its broken promise than all the soft perfections of his tender
Muse.&nbsp; He grew tired of imitation and ease.&nbsp; Weakness 
may exclude the world by forgetting it; only strength can conquer
the world.&nbsp; What if this law be also the law of 
beauty?&nbsp; The thought inspires his last great attempt, <!-- 
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>the fragment of <i>Hyperion</i>.&nbsp; Men have their 
dynasties and revolutions; but the immortals also, whom men 
worship, must change to live.</p>
<blockquote><p>So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,<br />
A power more strong in beauty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this power cannot be won by those who shirk the challenge 
of ugly facts.</p>
<blockquote><p>O folly! for to bear all naked truths,<br />
And to envisage circumstance, all calm,<br />
That is the top of sovereignty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if to enforce his thought by repetition, Keats made an 
allegorical framework for his revised version of the poem.&nbsp; 
There he exhibits himself as wandering among the delights of the 
garden of this life, and indulging himself to the point of 
drunkenness.&nbsp; Awaked from his swoon, he finds himself at the
steps of the temple of fame.&nbsp; He is told he must climb or 
die.&nbsp; After an agony of struggle he mounts to the top, and 
has speech there with a veiled figure, who tells him that this 
temple is all that has been spared in the war between the rival 
houses of the Gods.&nbsp; When he asks why he <!-- page 83--><a 
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>has been 
saved from death, the veiled figure makes reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;None can usurp this height,&rdquo; 
return&rsquo;d that shade,<br />
&ldquo;But those to whom the miseries of the world<br />
Are misery, and will not let them rest.&rdquo;<br />
* * * * *<br />
&ldquo;Are there not thousands in the world,&rdquo; said I,<br />
Encourag&rsquo;d by the sooth voice of the shade,<br />
&ldquo;Who love their fellows even to the death,<br />
Who feel the giant agony of the world,<br />
And more, like slaves to poor humanity,<br />
Labour for mortal good?&nbsp; I sure should see<br />
Other men here, but I am here alone.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Those whom thou spakest of are no visionaries,&rdquo;<br 
/>
Rejoined that voice; &ldquo;they are no dreamers weak;<br />
They seek no wonder but the human face,<br />
No music but a happy-noted voice:<br />
They come not here, they have no thought to come;<br />
And thou art here, for thou art less than they.<br />
What benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,<br />
To the great world?&nbsp; Thou art a dreaming thing,<br />
A fever of thyself: think of the earth;<br />
What bliss, even in hope, is there for thee?<br />
What haven? every creature hath its home,<br />
Every sole man hath days of joy and pain,<br />
Whether his labours be sublime or low&mdash;<br />
The pain alone, the joy alone, distinct:<br />
Only the dreamer venoms all his days,<br />
Bearing more woe than all his sins deserve.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>In this, which is almost his last deliberate utterance, 
Keats expresses his sense of the futility of romance, and seems 
to condemn poetry itself.&nbsp; A condemnation of the expression 
of profound thought in beautiful forms would come very ill from 
Keats, but this much he surely had learned, that poetry, the real
high poetry, cannot be made out of dreams.&nbsp; The worst of 
dreams is that you cannot discipline them.&nbsp; Their tragedy is
night-mare; their comedy is nonsense.&nbsp; Only what can stand 
severe discipline, and emerge the purer and stronger for it, is 
fit to endure.&nbsp; For all its sins of flatness and prosiness 
the Classical School has always taught discipline.&nbsp; No doubt
it has sometimes trusted too absolutely to discipline, and has 
given us too much of the foot-rule and the tuning-fork.&nbsp; But
one discipline, at least, poetry cannot afford to 
neglect&mdash;the discipline of facts and life.&nbsp; The poetry 
that can face this ordeal and survive it is rare.&nbsp; Some 
poets are tempted to avoid the experience and save the 
dream.&nbsp; Others, who were poets in their youth, undergo the 
experience and are beaten by it.&nbsp; But the poetry which can 
bear all naked truth and still keep its singing voice is the only
immortal poetry.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
